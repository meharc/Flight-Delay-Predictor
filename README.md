# Multi-class-Classification-with-ML
**Flight Delay Classifier** predicts whether a flight will be on time, slightly delayed, moderately delayed, or significantly delayed based on factors like departure time, airline, route distance, weather conditions, and past delays. This multi-class classification model handles time-based features, categorical variables, and class imbalance challenges. 🚀✈️

The pipeline contains data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. Includes logistic regression and random forests. Evaluates performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Supports hyperparameter tuning for optimal results. 

🔹 Key Features:

✔️ Data preprocessing and augmentation

✔️ Feature selection and engineering

✔️ Model training with scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch

✔️ Performance evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices

✔️ Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV & Bayesian Optimization
